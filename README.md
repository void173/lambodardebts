# Lambodar Debt Website

This is a **React-based** advertisement website developed by me and two of my team members for **Lambodar Debt**, a debt recovery company based in **Aurangabad**. The website was designed to showcase the company's services beyond debt recovery and included backend functionality to handle job applications.

## Features
- **Company Services Overview**: Displays the range of services offered by Lambodar Debt.
- **Job Application Portal**: Allows users to submit resumes if they are interested in joining the company.
- **Email Notifications**: Uses **Nodemailer** and **Google APIs** to notify the owner whenever a new job application is submitted.
- **Banking Connections Page**: A dedicated page for different banks to connect with Lambodar Debt.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, BootStrap, CSS
- **Backend**: Google APIs, Nodemailer, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

## How It Works
1. Users can explore the website to learn about Lambodar Debtâ€™s services.
2. If interested in a job, they can submit their resumes via the application form.
3. Once a resume is submitted, the system sends an email notification to the company's owner.
4. Banks looking to partner with Lambodar Debt can find relevant details on a dedicated page.

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Hackur45/lambodardebts.git
